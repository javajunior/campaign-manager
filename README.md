### The Challenge Requirements

The application should be a simple page with the following elements:

1. A list of Campaign which shows

- The Name
- The startDate
- The endDate
- A flag to state if the Campaign is active (a campaign is running when the current date is inside the start-end date range)
- The Budget (in USD dollar)

2. A Search Form before the list in order to filter the list by Campaign Name
3. A DateRange component that filters the list of campaigns based on a Start and End Date.
4. If the campaign has a startDate that is contained in the range, it should show
5. If the campaign has an endDate that is contained in the range, it should show.
6. You should not be able to select an end-date that is before the start-date.
7. If the endDate is before the start Date, the campaign should not show.

_Also, The candidate will expose a global method called &#39;AddCampaigns&#39; that takes an array of Campaigns and will render them.
This function will be invoked from the browserâ€™s JavaScript console for testing purposes. If it cannot be invoked, the submission will be rejected.
The method is allowed to be called multiple times. If so, the new campaigns will append to the existing list.
Example of campaign array that can be passed:_

```js
;[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Divavu',
    startDate: '9/19/2017',
    endDate: '3/9/2018',
    Budget: 88377,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Jaxspan',
    startDate: '11/21/2017',
    endDate: '2/21/2018',
    Budget: 608715,
  },
]
```
